# piggi

An attempt in writing a small language that transpiles to Javascript.

_An old previous self hosting-ish c(++ish) compiler can be looked at on the
`old-selfhostin-in-c` git branch._

## Status

Can do some basic things now. Take a look at `test.pig` and its output `test.js`
as reference for the languages and transpilers current capabilities.
