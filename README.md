# piggi

An attempt in writing a language with a ~~self hosting~~ compiler.

_Note that the self hosting part was removed for now with the C# rewrite because
it is too tedious to iterate on a language and the compiler at the same time.
Maybe later when everything has stabilized somewhat we can re-evaluate this._

_The old previous self hosting compiler can be looked at on the
`old-selfhostin-in-c` git branch._
